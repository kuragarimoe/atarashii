# Atarashii
The official repository for the UI frontend that powers the [Katagiri](https://kagami.katagiri.moe) website, and public developer API. This consists of all the inner workings and files that make the website itself work, alongside all of its stylesheets. A known fact is that a lot of this code can be simplified and rewritten, but such won't happen for a while.


## Requirements and Prerequisites
* MySQL
* PHP (7.4 or above)
* Node.js v12+ (Tested on v15, but v12 should work.)
* A setup [gulag](https://github.com/cmyui/gulag) instance readily available.

This UI was built to work with [gulag](https://github.com/cmyui/gulag), until a readily made alternative by the creators of Atarashii provide a better solution to work with the UI.

## Running It
This repository only exists to serve as a public front to the behind-the-scenes work to how Katagiri works; and to provide an open-source footprint for us to follow and preserve. Nonetheless, our licensing states that running instances of Atarashii and other Kuragari instances and projects are fine; but doing such will have no support from our sides. IF you wish to run a provided instance, then we fully trust that you have the capability to run this website if you were capable enough to setup something like PHP.

Furthermore, we kindly ask that if you run an instance of this website, that you remove all references to the Katagiri project, and the Kuragari team nigh-entirely. We accept credit for our work on this project, but not the usage of our assets without our permission. Licensing for external assets *used* by this frontend belong to the original creators and developers that made them to begin with.

### Special Contributors
* [cmyui](https://github.com/cmyui) for making [gulag](https://github.com/cmyui/gulag) exist, alongside being a general inspiration for a project like this by having done immense work on [Akatsuki](https://akatsuki.pw).
